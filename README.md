# 3D Graphics Project

## Overview

This project is dedicated to 3D graphics, focusing on rendering, manipulating, and testing 3D models. It is structured to provide tools and resources for both educational and development purposes in the field of computer graphics.

## Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **Modelos3DParaTeste**: This directory contains a collection of 3D models used for testing and demonstration purposes. These models can be used to test rendering capabilities, animations, and other 3D graphics functionalities.

- **Visual3D**: Here, you'll find the tools and scripts necessary for visualizing 3D models. This includes rendering software, libraries, and any additional resources needed to create and manipulate 3D visuals.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have a basic understanding of 3D graphics and possibly familiarity with the specific technologies and programming languages used within the directories. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `Modelos3DParaTeste` directory to find 3D models you can work with.
3. Dive into the `Visual3D` directory to access the visualization tools and scripts.
4. Follow any specific instructions or documentation found within each directory for setup and usage.

## Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the documentation, please feel free to make your changes and submit a pull request.
